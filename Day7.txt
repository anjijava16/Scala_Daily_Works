  Class : doesn't contain the main ()method

  Objectc   ==> main () you can able to run
               Every class must running from Object only because 
               of Object creation

In Scala Calling to the Object related methods directly no need to create any object

    ops1();
    ops2();
    ops3();
    ops4();


In Java Kind of lang we need create Object manually then only call the respective methods

  / ** Non Static methods java 
  MyClass ref=new MyClass();
  ref.ops1();
  ref.ops2();
  ref.ops3();
  ref.ops4();
